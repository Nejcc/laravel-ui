/**
 * This script is integral to the process of modularly incorporating Vue components
 * into the main application instance, facilitating their reuse across various parts 
 * of the application.
 * 
 * The script begins by importing 'ExampleComponent' from './components/ExampleComponent.vue'.
 * 'ExampleComponent' is a Vue Single File Component (SFC), designed to encapsulate specific
 * functionality or layout in a self-contained unit. This could be anything from a user interface
 * element, like a button or form, to a more complex feature, like a custom data display.
 * 
 * Following the import, the script exports the 'registerComponents' function. This function
 * accepts the primary Vue application instance ('app') as a parameter. Inside this function,
 * the 'app.component' method is employed to globally register the 'ExampleComponent'. 
 * The first argument, 'example-component', acts as the custom tag for this component, allowing 
 * it to be used in the applicationâ€™s templates with this name.
 * 
 * Globally registering the 'ExampleComponent' in this manner makes it available throughout the 
 * application, obviating the need for repeated imports. This strategy not only streamlines the
 * code but also enhances its maintainability and readability.

import ExampleComponent from './components/ExampleComponent.vue';

    app.component('example-component', ExampleComponent);
