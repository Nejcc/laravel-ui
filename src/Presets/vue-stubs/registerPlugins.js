/**
 * This segment of code demonstrates the integration of a specific Vue plugin into a Laravel-based
 * application. The plugin in question is 'Bootstrap5Pagination' from the 'laravel-vue-pagination'
 * package. This package provides a seamless way to incorporate pagination functionality consistent
 * with Bootstrap 5's styling, ensuring a cohesive and responsive user interface.
 *
 * The script begins by importing 'Bootstrap5Pagination' from the 'laravel-vue-pagination' library.
 * This component is designed to work with Laravel's pagination features, providing a Vue component
 * that automatically renders pagination controls based on Laravel's pagination response.
 * 
 * In the exported function 'registerPlugins', which is intended to be called with the main Vue 
 * application instance ('app'), the 'Bootstrap5Pagination' component is registered globally as 
 * 'pagination'. This registration process allows the pagination component to be used throughout
 * the application without the need for importing it in every component where pagination is needed.
 * 
 * By registering 'Bootstrap5Pagination' as 'pagination', it simplifies the usage in Vue templates.
 * Developers can now use <pagination></pagination> tags in their Vue templates to integrate
 * pagination functionality, leveraging Bootstrap 5's design for a consistent look and feel.
 *
 * This approach demonstrates how external plugins can be efficiently integrated into a Vue 
 * application within a Laravel context, enhancing functionality while maintaining code clarity
 * and ease of maintenance.
