/**
 * The 'registerGlobalMethods.js' file is designed to augment the Vue application with global methods. 
 * These methods are functions that are made available globally across all Vue components. This approach 
 * allows developers to define common logic or utilities once and then access them anywhere within the Vue 
 * application without having to import or redefine them in every component.
 * 
 * Global methods are typically used for functionality that is frequently needed across the application, 
 * such as formatting data, handling API calls, or providing utility functions like logging or error handling. 
 * By defining these methods globally, it helps in maintaining a DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) codebase, 
 * ensuring consistency in functionality and reducing the chance of code duplication.
 * 
 * The registration of these methods is usually done by attaching them to the Vue prototype or by using Vue 
 * mixins. This enables these methods to be invoked in any component context with ease. For instance, a 
 * globally registered method for formatting dates can be called in any component without needing to import 
 * a date utility library in each component.
 * 
 * It's important to note that while global methods provide convenience, they should be used judiciously. 
 * Overuse of global methods can lead to a bloated application and potential naming conflicts. Hence, they 
 * should be reserved for truly cross-cutting concerns that are applicable throughout the application.
 * 
 * Overall, 'registerGlobalMethods.js' plays a significant role in enhancing the Vue application's functionality, 
 * promoting code reusability, and aiding in maintaining a clean and efficient code structure.
